# Backend Documentation for My Next.js and Flask App

## Overview
This is the backend component of the My Next.js and Flask application. It is built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. The backend serves as an API for the frontend application, handling requests and managing data.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-nextjs-flask-app/backend
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

## Directory Structure

- **app/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **\_\_init\_\_.py**: Initializes the Flask application.
  - **routes.py**: Defines the API routes.
  - **models.py**: Contains data models.

- **venv/**: Virtual environment for the Flask application.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python packages.

## Usage
