## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   flask run
   ```

## Deployment

This application is configured for deployment on Netlify. Ensure that you have the `netlify.toml` file set up correctly for your build commands and redirects.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

The frontend is set up as a PWA, with a manifest file and service worker to enable offline capabilities and caching strategies.
